    "1. With a sharp knife, gently score duck breast skin in a tight crosshatch pattern and season with salt & pepper. Place duck breasts, skin side down, in a large, cold sauté pan. Place pan over low to medium-low heat. Continue cooking until much of the fat has rendered, the skin is golden brown, and duck's internal temperature is 125°F (52°C), about 15 minutes. Flip to flesh side and continue to cook for an additional 4 to 5 minutes depending on desired doneness. Remove from pan and rest.",
    "2. While duck is resting, sear red onions in the same sauté pan as the duck until onions are nice and charred.",
    "3. Mix together seared onions, garlic, ginger, scallions, herbs, jalapeños, chili crunch, and olive oil. Season with salt & pepper.",
    "4. Slice duck into 1/4 inch slices. Toss with herb salad. Serve on flour tortillas with additional condiments as desired."
